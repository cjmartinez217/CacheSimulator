# CacheSimulator
This repository allows you to simulate different cache types. To change the type of cache being simulated navigate to where the caches are initialized in the main
function in Main. Here you can change the size of the cache, the size of the lines in the cache as well as the number os lines per set for set associative caches. For
fully associative caches, make nWay equal to the maximum amount of lines that fit in the cache. You can also change the file that is parsed at the top of main if you 
wish to test different data.
